1. We didn't make our own GUI unit tests, Android has a tool to do that for 
us. With the emulator/phone app running use the command "adb shell monkey -p com.eecs448.kuville -v 1000" in
 the Android SDK/tools folder. 1000 (variable) is the number of GUI instances  the monkey tries at the app.
 
 2. Open the TestKUVille for the single JUnit test. This runs to test the number of children of the Facebook,
 Twitter, and Upgrade tabs.
 
 3. The output of the saved databases (Facebook, Twitter, and Upgrades) is in the DATABASE.txt file. This can be viewed 
 in LogCat whenever a tab is pressed, the corresponding database logs itself.
