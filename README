	- On Phone: move the file to Android device, open it, and install it 
	(may warn about installing third-party unlicensed software)
	- On Emulator: run the command "adb install KUVille.apk" with the emulator open (adb can be found
	in Android SDK tools folder)
	- NOTE: Must have version 4.0 or later to run!

		4. google-play-services_lib
		5. TestKUVille
2. To compile the folders:
	1. Open the Eclipse ADT provided by Google (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) and import all the folders.
	2. Right-click on KUVille and go to Properties -> Android
	3. Verify or add the Facebook, Google services, and Map Libraries
	4. Compile and run the project on Android device*
	*Facebook will not work because individual hash-keys of the compiling computer needed to be added to 
	the developer site on Facebook
	** Twitter should still login (but is not required for this version) to get Twitter feeds
3. There are two available maps to use, our MapLibrary developed by Jamie or Google maps.
	- To switch maps open MainFragment.java and uncomment the two startActivity methods (and comment the two that are not)
